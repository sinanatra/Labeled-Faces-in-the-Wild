        This visualisation arranges the faces from <em>Labeled Faces in the Wild</em>, a dataset for
        image recognition, sorting them by the most common.
    </p>
    <p> The dataset contains more than 13,000
        images, each one of them labeled with the name of the person pictured.
        <br>Created in 2007, this project is based on
        <em>Faces in the wild</em>, a dataset made in 2004 containing 30,281 faces collected from News Photographs, in
        particularly, Yahoo News. Since these images are taken in the wild rather than under fixed laboratory
        conditions,
        they represent a broad range of individuals, pose, expression, illumination conditions and time frames <span

        <br> Considering that
        2004 saw an increase of fighting in the Iraq War and George W. Bush was a main figure in tv reports, this
        subsequently led him to be the most portrait face in the dataset. Even though the work made in 2007 only
        selected
        one third of the images of the previous one, Bush still appeared 530 times. </p>
